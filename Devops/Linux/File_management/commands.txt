1) mv file name directory => moving file
2) cp file name directory => copying file
3) mv old filename new filename => rename file

note: Here we are using three methods absolute,relative,combined
     Absolute => mv file path dir path
             eg: mv /home/ec2-user/filename /home/ec2-user/dir
     Relative => particular directory name
             eg: mv /home/ec2-user/filename dir_name
     Combined => combination of absolute and relative
                 mv file (path or name) dir (path or name)
             eg: mv filename /home/ec2-user/dir
